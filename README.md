## Welcome to my Github-Page 

[(Ir a Versi√≥n en Espa√±ol)](https://github.com/esterodr)

My name is Esteban Rodr√≠guez, I'm an economist and professor of Statistics. For my work and personal projects I use the R programming language. Here I'm sharing some of the things I have done.

***

## Active Projects

**[Classes of my Statistics course](https://esterodr.github.io/Clases/)**

Material from the Statistics classes that I teach at the Facultad de Ciencias Econ√≥micas, Universidad de Buenos Aires.

**[2022 Fifa World Cup Probabilities](https://esterodr.github.io/Mundial/)**

Made for educational purposes to show how probabilities can be calculated through simulation. 

**[R Lab for a college level statistics course (Part 1)](https://github.com/esterodr/TP_Estadistica) and [(Part 2)](https://github.com/esterodr/TP2_Estadistica)**

Originally done for Tamara Burdisso's *Statistics I* course, at the *Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires*. Now it's beeing used at my *Statistics I* course, at the same university.  It has several excercises designed for students who do not have programming skills. It covers the main topics of a beginner Statistics course: graphs, indicators, probability, inference, linear regression. It runs on a Binder server (the links to run it are in the repository Readme file).

## Active Projects that I'm not updating any more

**[Argentina Monetary Charts](https://esterodr.github.io/BCRA/)**

Dashboard with economic information that I used to update daily. Useful in my work to quickly query key variables. It is based in Flexdashboard and ggplotly.

**[Argentina Monetary Charts (old version)](https://esterodr.github.io/Monitor_v2/index.html)**

First version of the previous Dashboard. More than 100 graphs with economic information updated daily. The site wasn't particularly pretty, but it did the job of helping me query variables quickly. It's made with RMarkdwon plus some basic Javascript. The graphs are made in ggplot and are static (that is why the same graph can appear several times with different temporality).

**[Balance Sheets of the Argentine Economy](https://esterodr.shinyapps.io/hojas_de_balance/)**. Tool to simulate the interrelationships between the different economic agents and the effects of certain policies. Useful both for educational purposes and for evaluating and discussing policies among colleagues. Entirely written in R with the Shiny app.

## Currently experimenting with

**Neural Networks** for time series forecasting.

**Text analysis** for the construction of economic indicators based on news and social networks.

**Trading bots**. I like trading but I don't have time to do it so I try to automate what I would do if I was looking at the screen.

I will upload more details about these projects soon.

## Archived Projects

Code used in my **[Master's Thesis in Economics](https://github.com/esterodr/DO)** of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. It consists of an estimation of the inequality of opportunities in Argentina through **regression trees and random forests**. The complete thesis can be downloaded from [here](http://bibliotecadigital.econ.uba.ar/econ/collection/tpos/document/1502-1541_RodriguezEE).

A few years ago I obtained the *Professional Certificate* of the *Data Science Specialization* from *HarvardX/Edx*. For this, I had to present the following final works:

**[Movie Ratings predictions using the MovieLens database](https://github.com/esterodr/MovieLens)**

**[Identification of fraudulent transactions in electronic payments](https://github.com/esterodr/fraud)**
